Think of the oldest library and ebooks.
Some years before, we travelled Egypt and visited Alexandria library. It was the first and oldest library. The library kept more 700.000 books of famous authors, scholars of the world, included books from ancient Greece, Rome. In some books, they wrote the birth of Alexandria city. The city was a cultural center in period Egypt under rule of Greece. Next period, Alexandria became a important business center on the trading road from East to West when Egypt was a province of Roman Empire from 30 year BC, after the fall of Queen Cleopad and General Marcus Antonious by Octavian. It was a special memory for books and history.
